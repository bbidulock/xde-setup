git tag -n100 -l 1.2

1.2             Maintenance Release 1.2

    This is the third release of the xde-setup package that provides a
    number of "C"-language tools for setting up light-weight window
    managers. It is not really used at the moment.

    This release is a maintenance release that is only intended on updating
    the build system, generating a better NEWS file, handles annotated tags
    better, and converts the release archives to lzip compression.

    Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
    from source. See the NEWS and TODO file in the release for more
    information. Please report problems to the issues list on GitHub.
