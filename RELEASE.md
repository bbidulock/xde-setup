Maintenance Release 1.2
=======================

This is the third release of the xde-setup package that provides a
number of "C"-language tools for setting up light-weight window
managers.  It is not really used at the moment.

This release is a maintenance release that is only intended on updating
the build system, generating a better NEWS file, handles annotated tags
better, and converts the release archives to lzip compression.

Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
from source.  See the [NEWS](NEWS) and [TODO](TODO) file in the release
for more information.  Please report problems to the issues list on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bbidulock/xde-setup/issues).
